# Overview

This software was developed to create a better understanding of Pandas and data analysis in a way that interested me. This way I can be able to go through data and pull what I need out of it to then use it as I need.

The data set used is a statistical analysis of professional soccer clubs in the Premier League between the years of 2006-2018.
The data set was found in this link:

With a love for soccer I enjoy seeing statistics of soccer teams. So I put my love of soccer and programming together by learning how to find my own statistics of soccer through programming. Finding statistics from great soccer teams from my favorite soccer league.
